# Project Name Readme

## Overview

Welcome to the project! This repository contains code for running experiments using StyleGAN3 and DCGAN. To reproduce the results, follow the instructions below.

## StyleGAN3 Setup

1. Go to the official [StyleGAN3 GitHub repository](https://github.com/stylegan/stylegan3).
2. Follow the instructions provided in the repository to set up StyleGAN3 on your machine.

## StyleGAN3 Experiment

1. Unzip the zip file named "styleGAN_experiements.zip" in this repository.
1. Copy the file `steer.ipynb` and the package `mylib` (which I wrote) to the root directory of your StyleGAN3 setup.
2. Make sure these files are placed under the StyleGAN3 root directory.

## DCGAN Experiment

2. Inside the unzipped folder, locate the file named `DCGAN.ipynb`.
3. Rerun each cell in the `DCGAN.ipynb` file to reproduce the second set of experiments.

## Note

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed as specified in the StyleGAN3 repository before running the code. If you encounter any issues, refer to the official documentation.
